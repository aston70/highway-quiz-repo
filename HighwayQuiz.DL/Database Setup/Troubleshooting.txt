An error occurred while processing your request

In the HighwayQuiz.Web.UI root folder, the NLog file HighwayQuiz.log.txt should

You'll likely see a message like this:
Login failed for user 'testyuser2'.

In SSMS, make sure testyuser2 has dbo membership.

If that still doesn't work, follow these instructions to reset the user login password.
It likely didn't get set correctly.
